	<!-- 
	 you'll see that we have one new and unique tag - the <wicket:panel> tag. 
	 This new tag tells wicket how much of the HTML source actually belongs to 
	 the panel. Why is this important? It allows us to provide gobs of template 
	 HTML around the panel, or what is often called 'preview markup'. 
	 This markup allows for multiple things to be done - first, the panel 
	 HTML page can now have custom documentation embedded in it. 
	 This would allow us to show it to someone who wanted to use our panel 
	 (let's say for the moment that we shipped it as a 'wicket extensions' library), 
	 and they could learn how to use it just by looking at this file.
	 In addition, this HTML allows us to supply boilerplate template layout 
	 that may not be necessary when the panel is used in context to a page - 
	 this allows the preview to look decent (or at least indicative to what you 
	 would want to see), without having to do anything magical. You'll also notice 
	 that I added a little header so we'd know that the panel was responsible for the 
	 rendering. -->
